                    representing inherently suspect types of business, such as work-at-home opportunities, shall not be allowed
                    to link); (b)the organization does not have an unsatisfactory record with us; (c) the benefit to us from
                    the visibility associated with the hyperlink outweighs the absence of Sustaining; and (d) where the
                    link is in the context of general resource information or is otherwise consistent with editorial content
                    in a newsletter or similar product furthering the mission of the organization.

                    of the linking party and it products or services; and (c) fits within the context of the linking party's
                    site.
