						<h2>About US and OUR project</h2>
						<p>This side was made of a group of students that were interested in the economy and wanted to do something for the environment. We are from two different school’s. One group of students is from the Teknikum- Växjö from Sweden and the other group is from the August- Griese Berufskollege from Germany. All groups together we are about 40 young people. It has took us a while to make the webside working. We were all working together while learning more about economy and the environment. Our basic idea was to make a webside where we are showing people what Fames and Shames are. When you are looking in the galarie you will see lots of images from people who were taking pictures of what they are doing, not only the fameful thinks, but also of the shameful thinks, they take responsible for their picutres.
