                      <p>Our project called "erasmus +" is a simple project wich was supported by the European Union. By presenting them the project in a very long textdocument the teachers of both involved schools did a great job. They made it possible for us to develop
                       this project. The project had to have a goal wich in our case was to develop this website and with help our countries by protecting the environment. The EU kindly sponsored this project with plenty of financial resources and made it possible for both, the swedish students traveling to Germany and the german students traveling to Sweden.
                      We are happy that the EU just made this whole project possible and that we are the students that has been entrusted with the honorable task do help our very neglected planet to heal.
