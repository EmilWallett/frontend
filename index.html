                        <h2>What is Fame?</h2>
                        <p>We think Fame is to behave sustainable. If you are sustaining and behave like your children’s grandchildren’s can have the same living standards as we do today. That means that we are living responsibly, minimizing metal usage and the waste of natural materials.</p>

                        <h2>What is Shame?</h2>
                        <!--text about shame-->
                        <p>We think Shame is the opposite of Fame. You are consciously consuming limited recourses, or produce too much CO2 that can’t be cleaned by the environment.</p>

                        <h3>Our Goals</h3>
                        <p>Our goal is to show people what is happening in our world. We want to show them the Fame things people do and the Shame things that we have to change. Also we want to get attention to our website and with that we want to encourage people to help protecting our world and the next generations.The pictures will help us to see what all the people in the world are doing good, or not, because if someone is just saying that he does a lot of Fame things he can’t actually prove that. With the pictures we can prove that and show other people how they easily do famefull thinks.</p>
