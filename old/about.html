                        <h2>About the project</h2>
                        <p>We are a group of about 40 students from Germany and Sweden. Our project is a collaboration between the schools and is funded by the EU. Our goal is to raise awareness for the changing climate and inspire the users to choose environmental friendly alternatives. The schools collaborating are Teknikum located in Växjö, Sweden and August-Griese Berufskolleg located in Löhne, Germany. We strive to develop this webpage to its fullest extent and this is still a work in development.</p>
                        <h2>About us</h2>
                        <p>Together we are a group of about 40 students in the age of about 16-21 and are being supported by 6 teachers from two schools.</p>
			<h3>German students</h3>
			<p>The German part of the students is coming from the August-Griese-Berufskollege located in Löhne. The general program is a vocational gymnasium. The students are currently studying for their general university entrance qualification with the main focus on information technology. That is for to also give the students the chance to become a technical assistant during their school time.</p>
			<h3>Swedish students</h3>
			<p>The Swedish part of the students is coming from the Teknikum located in Växjö. The students are also studying for the general university entrance qualification. They also get taught in a bunch of different information technology subjects like databases, computer technologies and application development.</p>

                        <h2>Fame</h2>
                        <p>We think Fame is to behave sustainable. If you are sustaining and behave like your children’s grandchildren’s can have the same living standards as we do today. That means that we are living responsibly, minimizing metal usage and the waste of natural materials.</p>
                        <h2>Shame</h2>
                        <p>We think Shame is the opposite of Fame. You are consciously consuming limited recourses, or produce too much CO2 that can’t be cleaned by the environment.</p>
			<h2>Goals</h2>
